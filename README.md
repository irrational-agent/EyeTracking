Work in progress...

Todo list:
- [ ] Refactor training code
- [ ] Remove database usage. Switch to regular folders (I prefer this for faster training because loading the database each time is terrible)
- [ ] Separate eye gaze data and eye openness data. (to record data separately. Now if you mess up data in the dataset, both gaze and openness data will be bad).
- [ ] Automate target movement in Unity app
- [ ] Recording indicators in Unity app
- [ ] Display recorded data samples count in Unity app
- [ ] Better eye openness visualization in Unity app?
